This a repo for the 2016 My Social Canvas Design for Her Hackathon submision, it contains all the code for the website and the product mockups.

# IlluminateHer
IlluminateHer was created to inspire and empower women in STEM. Fierce, power, and electric are all words to describe personal and professional traits women bring when working in STEM fields. While expressing a vital part of their identity through this fashion statement, they will also be contributing to the “National Girls Collaborative Project”. NGCP’s priority is to bring resources to girls in order to enhance their interest in STEM.  
We hope that the unique design of the phone case can spark a conversation about women in STEM with friends, classmates, or co-workers. Brining social awareness to women and their need of support from a social level. Along with the contributions made to NGCP, we hope to strengthen the connection between young girls and their passion in STEM fields.

The website was built in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

"The My Social Canvas DesignHackathon will bring together students who are pursuing degrees in fashion, graphic design, technology, and business in an effort to increase awareness, participation and funding for girls in STEM programs across the country. The final deliverable from each team will be an iPhone case design, an e-commerce site to sell their product, and a marketing plan to launch the product. Proceeds from the sales of the winning team's cases will go back to supporting Girls In STEM."
